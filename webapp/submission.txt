Project #8 - Submission form

Please fill in this form and submit it with your project #8.

Enter no more than 5 user stories that you did for the assignment that you would like to be
graded on. For each story include the following information:

Story number and name: 2 - @mentions in comments
Story points: 6
Brief description to see the story in action: Write a comment using an '@' in the comment
box under any photo to bring up a list of users that can be mentioned. Click on one of the
users to mention their name. Then complete the comment (if anything else is to be mentioned)
and click post to post the comment. Going to a user detail view allows a user to view all
mentions of the user. When an invalid user is mentioned, it does not result in the app crashing.
Each mention includes in the user detail view contains a thumbnail of the photo that can be
clicked on to change views to display the photo. The photo also contains the photo owner's name
that can be clicked on to view the owner's user detail page. Finally, if a user has no mentions,
the user detail page reflects that.

Story number and name: 3 - Visibility control on photos
Story points: 4
Brief description to see the story in action: Click on the upload photo button. In order to specify
who can view the photo that is about to be uploaded, check the specify permissions box, which should
bring up more checkboxes with each user whose checkboxes can be checked to set whether or not they
can view the image. Once the users are checked and the image is uploaded, the uploader and the users
checked can view the image from the user photos page. The users not checked cannot view the image.
If the image is uploaded without checking the specify permissions checkbox, every user can view the
image. If specify permissions is checked but no users are checked, only the owner can view the image.
This also interacts with the mentions story. Let's say user A and B can view an image but C cannot.
If user A mentions user C in a comment on that image, then users A and B can view the image in the
mentions section of user C's details page. However, user C cannot see this since they do not have
permissions to view the image and thus, do not know that they were mentioned.

Story number and name: 6 - Photo like votes
Story points: 4
Brief description to see the story in action: Go to the photos page of a user and click on the thumbs
up button to like an image. The page is immediately updated to sort the images by likes (and by most
recent next). The like count next to the thumbs up button updates and the like button is shaded to
reflect that the user has liked the image. The thumbs up button can be clicked again to unlike the
image and the count and shade of the thumbs up revert to reflect that the image has been unliked.

Story number and name: 7 - Favorite lists of photos for users
Story points: 6
Brief description to see the story in action: Go to the photos page of a user and click on the heart
button next to the thumbs up like button. The heart gets shaded to reflect that the image has been
favorited and the button gets disabled. Navigating to /favorites or clicking on the favorites button
on the tool bar takes a user to the favorites page showing all the favorited photos as thumbnails.
Clicking on a thumbnail opens up a modal window displaying a larger version of the image along with
its details. Clicking outside the modal window causes the modal window to close. Each thumbnail
contains an X icon on the top right corner to remove the photo as a favorite. If no photos were
favorited, the favorites page reflects that.

Story number and name: 9 - Tagging photos
Story points: 10
Brief description to see the story in action: Go to the photos page of a user. Click and drag a box
to select a region to be tagged. The box can be dragged in any direction and the box cannot extend
outside the range of the image (as the box is clipped at the border). Once the button is released, 
the box has been selected. Clicking elsewhere outside the box closes the box and allows another box
to be selected in case the user does not like the selected box. Once the box has been selected, the
list of users pops up and clicking on a user causes them to be tagged. Multiple tags can be selected
per photo, each with their own user name and the boxes selected can overlap. Hovering a mouse over a
photo displays all the boxes and hovering over a box displays a link with the user name of the user
tagged, which can be clicked on to show the user detail view of the user.
